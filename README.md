# DancePad

Credit to Promit. His pad design heavily inspired my design, and sensor design in particular was his: https://ventspace.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/danceforce-v3-diy-dance-pad-controller/

Super Make Something also had a substantial influence on my final design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXjj9IXUaA4

# Design and measurement
Before starting this project I read every DDR build guide I could find and incorporated the pieces I liked into my ultimate design.
I especially liked Promit's design, but had one major issue with it. His uses a giant piece of plexi across the entire pad. I wanted a pad that had discrete physical "buttons." 

I also wanted a pretty heavy pad. I'm a big guy and wanted something I knew would stand up to me stomping on it. A heavier feel would also feel more "arcade-like" to me, especially since I'll be playing on carpet. This led me to go with a larger overall height for my pad (1.5" in total with a 3/4" solid base).


Your plywood will need to be broken down to the following sizes:
Base: 35" x 35" (1)
Edges: 1" x 34" (4)
Static plates: 11" x 11" (5)

I had the base cut out of the original plywood sheet, which was a big help. 
I went into this project with no woodworking experience, and breaking down the wood into the right sizes with nice perpendicular cuts was a major challenge. If you're new to woodworking make sure you have a strategy to ensure you get nice straight cuts. Using a track saw or tablesaw would help a lot, or at least make sure to use carefully positioned guides with a circular saw (which is what I ultimately did).

After cutting all of the plywood I glued the 1" borders to the base, and then spray painted the sides of the base and the borders.

While waiting for that to dry I added a chamfer to the edges of the "static" plates on the sides where I would want to run wires later. This was one side for the two top corners, and all 4 sides of the center. With that done I then painted these as well.
