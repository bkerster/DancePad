# DancePad

Credit to Promit. His pad design heavily inspired me, and sensor design in particular was his: https://ventspace.wordpress.com/2018/04/09/danceforce-v3-diy-dance-pad-controller/

Super Make Something also had a substantial influence on my final design: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nXjj9IXUaA4

# Design and measurement
Before starting this project I read every DDR build guide I could find and incorporated the pieces I liked into my ultimate design.
I especially liked Promit's design, but had one major issue with it. His uses a giant piece of plexi across the entire pad. I wanted a pad that had discrete physical "buttons." 

I also wanted a pretty heavy pad. I'm a big guy and wanted something I knew would stand up to me stomping on it. A heavier feel would also feel more "arcade-like" to me, especially since I'll be playing on carpet. This led me to go with a larger overall height for my pad (1.5" in total with a 3/4" solid base).

I was able to complete this project 100% on my small outdoor patio while living in a small apartment. With access to a better shop this project would be much easier.


Your plywood will need to be broken down to the following sizes:
Base: 35" x 35" (1)
Edges: 1" x 34" (4)
Static plates: 11" x 11" (5)

I had the base cut out of the original plywood sheet, which was a big help. 
I went into this project with no woodworking experience, and breaking down the wood into the right sizes with nice perpendicular cuts was a major challenge. If you're new to woodworking make sure you have a strategy to ensure you get nice straight cuts. Using a track saw or tablesaw would help a lot, or at least make sure to use carefully positioned guides with a circular saw (which is what I ultimately did).

After cutting all of the plywood I glued the 1" borders to the base, and then spray painted the sides of the base and the borders.

While waiting for that to dry I added a chamfer to the edges of the "static" plates on the sides where I would want to run wires later. This was one side for the two top corners, and all 4 sides of the center. With that done I then painted these as well (just the top). I then placed these on the pad, but did *not* glue them down yet.

This is a good time to tape a large copper + shape down across the length of the pad. This will serve as the common ground for the sensors later. Doing it now allows you to run under where the center plate will be glued down later.

## Sensor Construction
The next step was to prepare the sensors. These were each constructed out of two pieces of 1/4" MDF, copper tape, and velostat. 
The first piece of MDF is effectively just a riser, to ensure the final total height for the sensor plus a sheet of plexiglass is about the same height as the border.
This piece I cut to 11" x 10.5" The shorter width is to provide space between the sensor and the center plate for wiring.
The second piece of MDF I cut to 9 3/4" x 9 1/4". After cutting to size I covered one side of each piece of MDF completely with copper tape. The smaller sheet I also placed a piece of copper tape such that it started on the copper side and wrapped around to create a small copper tab on the uncovered side. This is to be used later as an attachment point for the wiring, since the copper side will be facedown and inaccessible.

The velostat works as a pressure sensitive resistor, so when its sandwiched between the two copper coated pieces the current across them will change as the pressure on them increases. The next step is to put a sheet of velostat in place. First it needs to be cut just smaller than the dimensions of the larger piece of MDF. Then tape it to the copper side of the larger sheet. I used double sided tape for this on two edges. Its important that the velostat is not stretched when its taped down. After that tape smaller sheet copper side down to the larger sheet with the velostat sandwiched in the middle. I used duct tape for this on two sides. Its important to not tape too tightly so the velostat isn't under too much pressure when your not standing on it. The final step is to add foam to the other two sides. I used 3 small pieces on each side which seemed to provide a good level of firmness and springiness. 

Once you have 4 of those built glue them into place. I put the bottom, left, and right sensors back against the border which left about 1/2" of space to use to connect wiring. The top sensor I left the gap between the sensor and the border instead, which makes wiring that sensor and the ground easier.
